**GoodData Cloud** is a solution with a powerful analytics engine, an efficient query language, and a resilient semantic data layer â€“ all built with developers in mind.

## GoodData Cloud and GoodData.UI

GoodData Cloud is an API-first product and comes with a comprehensive REST API that exposes all its functionality.

GoodData.UI builds on top of these REST APIs and encapsulates them in the **Analytical Backend** abstraction that exposes
the analytical capabilities to UI components. GoodData.UI provides several packages that help communicate with GoodData Cloud:

-  `@gooddata/api-client-tiger` is a low-level API client interfacing with the GoodData Cloud REST APIs.
-  `@gooddata/sdk-backend-tiger` is a library that implements the **Analytical Backend** abstraction on top of GoodData Cloud.

All the React components of GoodData.UI are located in the packages prefixed with `@gooddata/sdk-ui-`. These packages use
exclusively the Analytical Backend abstraction and are thus separated from the implementation details of a specific backend.

A typical GoodData.UI application creates and configures an instance of the GoodData Cloud Analytical Backend once and then uses this instance in all React components.
