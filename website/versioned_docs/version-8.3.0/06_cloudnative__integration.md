This document outlines the important steps you need to undertake if you need to integrate GoodData.UI into an existing
React application or for some reason you cannot use [accelerator toolkit](02_start__using_boilerplate.md) to bootstrap a new application.

## Before you begin

If you used `create-react-app` to create your application, make sure that the `react-scripts` dependency is set to version 4.0.3. Version 5.0.0 and newer is not supported.

## Step 1. Install the necessary dependencies

GoodData.UI can target multiple platforms. Therefore, it is essential to install packages for the right target platform. For
GoodData.CN, you need to install packages codenamed `tiger`:

```bash
yarn add @gooddata/api-client-tiger @gooddata/sdk-backend-tiger
```

On top of this, you can pick and choose packages depending on which GoodData.UI components you plan to use. For more information, see the table included in the [architecture overview](01_intro__framework_overview.md).

-  If you plan to use only headless React components and essential infrastructure, install:

   ```bash
   yarn add @gooddata/sdk-ui
   ```

-  If you plan to use all available GoodData.UI visualizations, install:

   ```bash
   yarn add @gooddata/sdk-ui-charts @gooddata/sdk-ui-pivot @gooddata/sdk-ui-geo @gooddata/sdk-ui-ext
   ```

-  If you plan to use all components of GoodData.UI, install:

   ```bash
   yarn add @gooddata/sdk-ui-all
   ```

We also highly recommend that you use the [catalog-export](02_start__catalog_export.md) tool to generate a file with
code representation of all available measures and attributes in your GoodData.CN workspace. You can then use this
generated code to specify what data to render in the visual components. To add `@gooddata/catalog-export` as a dev dependency, execute the following command:

```bash
yarn add --dev @gooddata/catalog-export
```

## Step 2. Include styles

GoodData.UI uses CSS to style the components. Each package whose name is prefixed with `sdk-ui` contains CSS files that you need to include or import in your application. The following list shows all the possible imports you may need:

```jsx
import "@gooddata/sdk-ui-filters/styles/css/main.css";
import "@gooddata/sdk-ui-charts/styles/css/main.css";
import "@gooddata/sdk-ui-geo/styles/css/main.css";
import "@gooddata/sdk-ui-pivot/styles/css/main.css";
import "@gooddata/sdk-ui-kit/styles/css/main.css";
import "@gooddata/sdk-ui-ext/styles/css/main.css";
```

Make sure to import the styles only from the packages that you actually use.

**NOTE**: `@gooddata/sdk-ui-kit` is a library of elementary components (buttons, dropdowns, overlays) required by different GoodData.UI components. The best practice is to import all their CSS files and eventually remove those that make the application build fail.

## Step 3. Set up Analytical Backend and integrate it into your application

All integration and communication of GoodData.UI React components and the GoodData platform happens via the **Analytical Backend** abstraction. Your application should initialize an instance of the Analytical Backend as soon as possible as follows:

```javascript
import tigerFactory, { ContextDeferredAuthProvider, redirectToTigerAuthentication } from "@gooddata/sdk-backend-tiger";

const backend = tigerFactory().withAuthentication(new ContextDeferredAuthProvider(redirectToTigerAuthentication));

// or if your application will be hosted on a different host than the GoodData.CN backend
const backend = tigerFactory()
    .onHostname("https://example.com") // this should be the domain where the GoodData.CN is hosted
    .withAuthentication(new ContextDeferredAuthProvider(redirectToTigerAuthentication));
```

Depending on the type and style used in your application, you can either store an instance of `backend` in a read-only global
variable or use React contexts.

This is how you can set contexts that hold both an instance of the Analytical Backend and the identifier of the GoodData platform workspace that you are targeting:

```jsx
import { BackendProvider, WorkspaceProvider } from "@gooddata/sdk-ui";

function App() {
    return (
        <BackendProvider backend={backend}>
            <WorkspaceProvider workspace="<your-workspace-identifier>">
                <YourApp/>
            </WorkspaceProvider>
        </BackendProvider>
    );
}
```

**NOTE**: If you are building a React application, the contexts are the best way to go. All GoodData.UI components
are context-aware and will retrieve both `backend` and `workspace` to use.

## Step 4. Solve Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

The interaction with third-party APIs and services from the browser is protected by the [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) mechanism (CORS). Correct CORS setup is mainly a server-side concern.

The GoodData.CN All-in-One image is already configured to allow cross-origin requests coming from a GoodData.UI
application running on `https://localhost:8443`.

If you run into CORS and authentication issues while developing on localhost, see [Set Up Development on Workstation](06_cloudnative__local_dev.md) for viable development setup that does not require any additional GoodData.CN reconfiguration.

## Step 5. Configure authentication

You may have noticed that the code snippet in [Step 3](#step-3.-set-up-analytical-backend-and-integrate-it-into-your-application) set up authentication to use `ContextDeferredAuthProvider`. This effectively tells the Analytical Backend that your application takes care of handling setup of the authenticated session to GoodData.CN.

In this particular example, when the session is not authenticated, your application uses the built-in `redirectToTigerAuthentcation` function to redirect the browser window to a location where the GoodData.CN authentication flow starts.

Once redirected to this location, the GoodData.CN server starts the OpenID Connect (OIDC) authentication flow according to its
configuration. Once the flow finishes, the server replies with a redirect response that will take the browser back to your application window.

The configuration listed in [Step 3](#step-3.-set-up-analytical-backend-and-integrate-it-into-your-application)is the recommended configuration for the production deployment where the application is served either from the same origin as GoodData.CN or from a different origin with correct CORS and authentication cookies configuration.

If you run into CORS and authentication issues while developing on localhost, see [Set Up Development on Workstation](06_cloudnative__local_dev.md) for viable development setup that does not require any additional GoodData.CN reconfiguration.

## Next steps

At this point, your application should be set to use GoodData.UI and render visualizations from the GoodData platform. If you
also configured and run the [catalog-export](02_start__catalog_export.md) tool, you can now start embedding visualizations
into your application:

```jsx
import { LineChart } from "@gooddata/sdk-ui-charts";
import { YourFact, YourMeasure, YourAttribute} from "./generatedLdm";

function MyVisualization() {
    const measures = [YourFact.Sum, YourMeasure];
    const attributes = [ YourAttribute.DisplayFormName ];

    return (
      <LineChart
          measures={measures}
          trendBy={attribute}
      />
    );
}
```

**NOTE:** The imports from `generatedLdm` are for illustration purposes. You can name the file with the generated LDM as you see fit and store it in any location. The names of constants in the generated file will reflect the facts, measures, and attributes in your workspace.

Here are some suggestions about what you can do after you created your first visualization:

* Add more elements: tables, charts, custom visualizations. For more information, see [Start with Visual Components](10_vis__start_with_visual_components.md).
* [Enable drilling](15_props__drillable_item.md).
* Add a [customizable theme](10_vis__theme_provider.md) to your application.
