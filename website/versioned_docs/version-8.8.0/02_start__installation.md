This article describes how to install GoodData.UI and a few steps to accomplish before you can start creating your visualizations.

**NOTE:** Before you install GoodData.UI, make sure that you have a GoodData account (see [About GoodData.UI](01_intro__about_gooddataui.md#supported-technologies)).

## Installation

Run the following to install packages necessary to render charts:

```bash
yarn add @gooddata/sdk-backend-bear @gooddata/sdk-model @gooddata/sdk-ui @gooddata/sdk-ui-charts @gooddata/sdk-ui-pivot @gooddata/sdk-ui-geo @gooddata/sdk-ui-ext
```

```bash
npm install @gooddata/sdk-backend-bear @gooddata/sdk-model @gooddata/sdk-ui @gooddata/sdk-ui-charts @gooddata/sdk-ui-pivot @gooddata/sdk-ui-geo @gooddata/sdk-ui-ext
```

**NOTE:** Check out [Architecture Overview](01_intro__framework_overview.md) to learn about additional packages that
you can include and render (for instance, pivot tables or geo pushpin charts).

### Important: Use the same version everywhere

For smooth developer experience, make sure that your application always uses the same versions of all GoodData.UI packages. Do not
mix and match different versions. Always upgrade the `@gooddata` packages to the same version.

## Before you start coding

1. Get your **workspace ID**. The workspace ID is a unique 32-character identifier of your workspace within the GoodData platform. You need your workspace ID to connect your workspace with the visualizations that you are going to create. To get your workspace ID, see [Find the Workspace ID](https://help.gooddata.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=34341289).
2. Obtain **object identifiers** using [catalog-export](02_start__catalog_export.md). The object identifier is a reference to a workspace object. You need the identifiers to display attributes, measures, visualizations, filters, and other objects.

    The identifier of an object is consistent across your domain regardless of the GoodData workspace it lives in. The object identifier is a text string. **Example:** `franchiseFeesAdRoyaltyIdentifier`

3. Pick a **visualization type** from the prepared React components (table, column chart, bar chart, and so on) and, optionally, one or more properties to use with the selected visualization. Alternatively, you can fetch raw data and create a fully custom visualization.
